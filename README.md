## How did I get into coding?

I have always possessed the mindset of a programmer - the ability to find solutions to real world problems. Even during my bachelorâ€™s in aerospace systems engineering, I was consistently drawn to avionics architecture, ARINC databuses and their communication protocols. I also covered Aerothermodynamics and propulsion, but it was always the systems portions that really excited me. In 2014, while playing around with static themes, I realized I loved the process of manipulating code. With coding, I have found it to be the summation of complex problem solving that has the power to make a genuine difference in the world. It is truly an endeavor like no other.
